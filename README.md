# About
***Tired of writing down or typing quotes by hand?***</br>
Quote Clipper allows you to take a picture of the page you are reading, and uses text recognition to convert the page into text so that you don't need to type every word you want to save.

***What if the text recognition isn't perfect?***</br>
Don't worry. You can edit the text the app generates. Once you are happy, press Save.</br>
If you want to save the quote elsewhere (share it with your friends maybe), press and hold the quote, and you will be able to save it to clipboard.
